Welcome to AFX Tech!

If you're using a Mac, you can follow these [Mac-specific setup instructions](SetupOnMac.md).

If you're using Windows, you can follow these [instructions to set up using an Ubuntu virtual machine](SetupUsingVM.md). (You can actually follow these instructions even if you use a Mac, but it's not recommended.)

After you're done, for each repo you want to clone, follow the [per-repo setup instructions](SetupPerRepo.md).
